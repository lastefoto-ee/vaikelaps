Then the photo session &lt;strong>Young Abstract Artist&lt;/strong> with canvas and edible colors is what you need to unleash the potential of your genius!&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Bright, juicy shots&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fast photo session (will end before the onset of the creative crisis)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Canvas with a masterpiece - as a gift&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Although this type of photo shoot is an absolute novelty in Tallinn, I have already managed to shoot enough to reveal interesting patterns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./photosession-with-ediable-colors-1.jpg" alt="baby photo session with colors">&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="as-with-the-cake-smash-photo-session-not-all-kids-immediately-take-to-the-dirty-business-and-thats-okay">As with the “Cake Smash!” photo session, not all kids immediately take to the “dirty” business. And that&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./photosession-with-ediable-colors-2.jpg" alt="baby photo session">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All people need time to adapt to a new space, and small ones especially.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./photosession-with-ediable-colors-3.jpg" alt="photosession with colors in Tallinn">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I always take this time with a margin, and also take into account additional breaks for drinking-eating-peeing. So, if anything goes wrong, do not worry, we will definitely have time for everything, even if the baby does not immediately grab the paint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./photosession-with-ediable-colors-4.jpg" alt="photosession with colors">&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="surprisingly-but-not-all-kids-love-getting-dirty">Surprisingly but not all kids love getting dirty.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Just yesterday I had a little princess on the session, who didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get her sweet fingers dirty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./photosession-with-ediable-colors-5.jpg" alt="photosession with colors in Tallinn">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But we found a way out. We painted with all available means: a spoon, a toy hammer, a bagel with poppy seeds and even a piece of cardboard were used. And the result is great!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./photosession-with-ediable-colors-6.jpg" alt="baby session with edible colors in Tallinn">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So do not worry if something does not go according to the intended scenario: impromptu, as a rule, is even more interesting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./photosession-with-ediable-colors-7.jpg" alt="photosession with colors in Tallinn">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tell us if your children like to be smeared with something? What did they wash from for the longest time? Markers, huh?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Baby photo session in Tallinn</title><link>https://www.xn--vikelaps-0za.ee/en/project/baby-photosession-11/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021
