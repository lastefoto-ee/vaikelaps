&lt;p>As a rule, it is better for no one to hear how such photo sessions proceeds. A photo session for babies is most often similar to a circus. Meowing, grunting, growling, sneezing are at the top of the list of those skills that a photographer needs to master. It&amp;rsquo;s good if the role of such an animator is dad/older brother/sister/grandmother. But most often it is the photographer himself.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Usually, at the very beginning of photo shooting, the babies are happy to look at the camera. In this case, we work as quickly as possible and do not make any special noise or sounds. Usually I even ask you not to attract the baby&amp;rsquo;s attention. This will be needed when the baby gets tired, starts to get distracted and looks away from the camera.
Most often, somewhere in the middle of the photo shooting, all the sounds that were used will cease to interest the baby - and this is normal. Here we usually take a short break.
Then, depending on the mood of the baby, the photo session can go either as in the first half, or we forget about posing and control the child&amp;rsquo;s position a little. For example, we hold baby&amp;rsquo;s hands so that they do not “fly” much, pull them out of mouth.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;p>Each photo session is a new experience for a baby. If at home the baby is usually active, smiling and not capricious, do not wait that this is how he will behave at the photo session. And this is absolutely normal! He comes to a new place, sees a new person, who sometimes has something incomprehensible instead of a face, if we add here the mother’s anxiety “how will everything go?”, then this is a serious reason to start worrying with her.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Calmness. You are in good hands! Usually, after 10-15 minutes, the kids get used to it and all that remains is to catch their radiant smiles!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Older kids are frequent guests of my studio. 🥰&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just dive into those eyes! 😍&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With grown-up babies in a photoshoot the exact same rule applies as in shooting with newborns -&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="calm-mom--calm-baby">calm mom = calm baby&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./baby-photosession-2.jpg" alt="Baby photosession in Tallinn">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go to the shooting with a smile and a calm heart (yes, no need to panic), tell your kid where and why you are going, let him see your confidence and good mood!&lt;/p>

Then the photo session &lt;strong>Young Abstract Artist&lt;/strong> with canvas and edible colors is what you need to unleash the potential of your genius!&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Bright, juicy shots&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fast photo session (will end before the onset of the creative crisis)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Canvas with a masterpiece - as a gift&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Although this type of photo shoot is an absolute novelty in Tallinn, I have already managed to shoot enough to reveal interesting patterns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./photosession-with-ediable-colors-1.jpg" alt="baby photo session with colors">&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="as-with-the-cake-smash-photo-session-not-all-kids-immediately-take-to-the-dirty-business-and-thats-okay">As with the “Cake Smash!” photo session, not all kids immediately take to the “dirty” business. And that&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./photosession-with-ediable-colors-2.jpg" alt="baby photo session">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All people need time to adapt to a new space, and small ones especially.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./photosession-with-ediable-colors-3.jpg" alt="photosession with colors in Tallinn">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I always take this time with a margin, and also take into account additional breaks for drinking-eating-peeing. So, if anything goes wrong, do not worry, we will definitely have time for everything, even if the baby does not immediately grab the paint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./photosession-with-ediable-colors-4.jpg" alt="photosession with colors">&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="surprisingly-but-not-all-kids-love-getting-dirty">Surprisingly but not all kids love getting dirty.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Just yesterday I had a little princess on the session, who didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get her sweet fingers dirty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./photosession-with-ediable-colors-5.jpg" alt="photosession with colors in Tallinn">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But we found a way out. We painted with all available means: a spoon, a toy hammer, a bagel with poppy seeds and even a piece of cardboard were used. And the result is great!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./photosession-with-ediable-colors-6.jpg" alt="baby session with edible colors in Tallinn">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So do not worry if something does not go according to the intended scenario: impromptu, as a rule, is even more interesting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./photosession-with-ediable-colors-7.jpg" alt="photosession with colors in Tallinn">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tell us if your children like to be smeared with something? What did they wash from for the longest time? Markers, huh?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
