Then the photo session Young Abstract Artist with canvas and edible colors is what you need to unleash the potential of your genius!\n Bright, juicy shots Fast photo session (will end before the onset of the creative crisis) Canvas with a masterpiece - as a gift  Although this type of photo shoot is an absolute novelty in Tallinn, I have already managed to shoot enough to reveal interesting patterns.\nAs with the “Cake Smash!” photo session, not all kids immediately take to the “dirty” business. And that\u0026rsquo;s okay. All people need time to adapt to a new space, and small ones especially.\nI always take this time with a margin, and also take into account additional breaks for drinking-eating-peeing. So, if anything goes wrong, do not worry, we will definitely have time for everything, even if the baby does not immediately grab the paint.\nSurprisingly but not all kids love getting dirty. Just yesterday I had a little princess on the session, who didn\u0026rsquo;t want to get her sweet fingers dirty.\nBut we found a way out. We painted with all available means: a spoon, a toy hammer, a bagel with poppy seeds and even a piece of cardboard were used. And the result is great!\nSo do not worry if something does not go according to the intended scenario: impromptu, as a rule, is even more interesting!\nTell us if your children like to be smeared with something? What did they wash from for the longest time?
