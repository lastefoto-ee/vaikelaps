Schedule your Cake Smash photo shoot keeping naps and bedtime in mind\nWhen planning a cake smash photo shoot, keep bedtime in mind. The goal of cake smash photo shoot is to capture your baby\u0026rsquo;s personality, so we want to make sure they are well rested. If your baby is on a schedule and takes naps at the same time every day, I will work around that schedule. If your baby is not on a schedule but is happiest at certain times of the day, please schedule the session during that time.\nLet your baby be a little hungry\nAlthough I usually advise feeding your child before a session to prevent them from being starving and grumpy, it can occasionally be helpful for cake smash photo shoot if your child is just a little bit hungry. Of course, continue to feed them, but if they are a little bit hungry when you bring them to the shoot, they may be more likely to eat the cake. When they see the cake after having just finished a full meal, they might not be as willing and ready to eat more.\nBring baby\u0026rsquo;s favorite snack\nHave your baby\u0026rsquo;s favorite food on hand if you are concerned that your child won\u0026rsquo;t eat the cake right away. Whatever their \u0026ldquo;always makes them happy\u0026rdquo; food is — bring those with you.

A photo session for babies is most often similar to a circus. Meowing, grunting, growling, sneezing are at the top of the list of those skills that a photographer needs to master. It\u0026rsquo;s good if the role of such an animator is dad/older brother/sister/grandmother. But most often it is the photographer himself.\nBaby photo shoot in Tallinn Usually, at the very beginning of photo shooting, the babies are happy to look at the camera. In this case, we work as quickly as possible and do not make any special noise or sounds. Usually I even ask you not to attract the baby\u0026rsquo;s attention. This will be needed when the baby gets tired, starts to get distracted and looks away from the camera. Most often, somewhere in the middle of the photo shooting, all the sounds that were used will cease to interest the baby - and this is normal. Here we usually take a short break. Then, depending on the mood of the baby, the photo session can go either as in the first half, or we forget about posing and control the child\u0026rsquo;s position a little. For example, we hold baby\u0026rsquo;s hands so that they do not “fly” much, pull them out of mouth.\nMother and baby photo session Each photo session is a new experience for a baby. If at home the baby is usually active, smiling and not capricious, do not wait that this is how he will behave at the photo session. And this is absolutely normal! He comes to a new place, sees a new person, who sometimes has something incomprehensible instead of a face, if we add here the mother’s anxiety “how will everything go?”, then this is a serious reason to start worrying with her.\nMother and baby photo shoot in the studio Calmness. You are in good hands!
